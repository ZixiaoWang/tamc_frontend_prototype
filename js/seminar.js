The beauty of simplicity in this design comes from the two flanking panels and sharp edges allow for versatility in lighting effects throughout the event.</li><li>Featuring 5 giant LED panels this conference backdrop will be one to remember allowing for the panels to be truly interactive and alive as the backdrop and feel of the sessions can be modified with each individual session. Alternatively, some of the panels can be changed to regular production for a more cost conscious approach.</li></ul>',
