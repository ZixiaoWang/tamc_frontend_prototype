# TAMC_frontend_prototype
The prototype of TAMC site. 
Build by J.W
Jan 2016

# Description 
This prototype was built for two reasons:
1. I got paid.
2. I need to practice AngularJS.

# How can I preview this site?
This prototype requires a web server. 
Download the package and unzip it into ROOT directory of any running web server.
Enter http://<your-server-ip>:<your-server-port>/index.html.

# Comments
Well I suppose no one would see this except me...
I don't think it's a good quality site but practices shall always be essential.
